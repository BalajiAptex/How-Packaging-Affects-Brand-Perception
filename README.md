# How-Packaging-Affects-Brand-Perception
Packaging in apparel shapes first impressions, trust, and brand recall. At Balaji Aptex, we treat packaging as part of the garment—protecting quality, enhancing unboxing experience, and reinforcing brand identity. Thoughtful packaging boosts perceived value, customer satisfaction, and long-term brand positioning.
